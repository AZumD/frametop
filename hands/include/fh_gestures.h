/*
 * fh_gestures - hand gestures ft-hands publishes for input (the pointer helper): look at
 * something and pinch to click it, or close the hand (a grip) to press and drag it (the
 * Vision Pro model, with the eye tracker doing the looking).
 * /run/user/UID/frametop-hands/gestures, next to the hands
 * file, with the same sequence lock (read seq, copy, read seq again; use the copy only if
 * both reads are the same even number) and the same frame: metres in the head frame at
 * capture time, OpenVR's HMD frame (+x right, +y up, -z forward).
 *
 * One slot per side and gesture: pinch[0] and grip[0] are the left hand, [1] the right.
 * A gesture follows the hand it began on until it ends.
 *   Pinch: begins when the thumb and index tips close within begin_m and ends when they
 * open past end_m (the gap between keeps it from flickering). point is the index and middle
 * knuckles, which don't move as the fingers open and close (the tips' midpoint did).
 *   Grip: a closed hand. It begins when all four fingers are curled in (each fingertip
 * nearer the wrist than grip_begin times its knuckle is) and ends when they open past
 * grip_end on average. distance is that average (about 2 open, under 1.2 closed), strength
 * 0 open .. 1 closed, and point the palm's centre. A grip ends a pinch on the same hand
 * (closing the hand can pass through a pinch on the way), as lost.
 * Either ends, as lost (FH_PINCH_LOST), when its hand stays lost too long.
 *
 * Don't miss short gestures: a reader that polls slower than a quick tap still sees it,
 * because begins and ends count every one. When begins changed, one began at begin_ns;
 * when ends changed, one ended at end_ns. begins - ends is 1 while it's down.
 *
 * Drags: point is where the gesture is now, begin_point where it began. Turn each into the
 * room with the HMD pose at its capture time (capture_ns, begin_ns) before subtracting,
 * so turning your head doesn't drag.
 *
 * Version 1 had only the pinches (192 bytes); version 2 adds the grips after them.
